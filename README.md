## Project Description

Pulse is a web-based platform that helps businesses and organizations anticipate and plan for demand fluctuations by analyzing the impact of local events, news, weather, and other factors on hospitality and urban activity.

Hotels, event organizers, and city planners often struggle to predict demand spikes around large concerts, conferences, sports games, or sudden local developments. **Pulse addresses this by providing actionable insights and forecasts** for these scenarios.

The system automates the collection, analysis, and distribution of event-driven insights, empowering businesses of all sizes to make data-informed decisions with speed and confidence.
